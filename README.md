# TaDaList
Reflect on your day and check what you did, for the dopamine, but without the pressure of a To do list.

# Who's the target ?
Me. And people like me, who sometimes feels that a too big todolist is a lot of pressure but want some easy dopamine hit when they achieve something.

# Why not use any other todolist or tracker app?
Because I don't like them. I tried a lot of them, and failing a streak is the best way for me to abandon the routine. And I don't want to create gigantic todolist for the routine like showering or having a healthy meal. 

# So what ?
Think like a reflecting app. At the end of the day, or whenever you want, you open the app and select the mundane tasks you did today.

You check, you're proud of yourself, I'm proud of you, you close the app, go on on your day.
No reminders, no guilt, you do you when you need to.
