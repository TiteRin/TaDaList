# Ta Da !!
Reflect on your day and check what you did, for the dopamine, but without the pressure of a To Do list.

# Who's the target ?
Me. 
And people like me, who sometimes feels that a too big todolist is a lot of pressure but want to feel proud of themselves.
It doesn’t matter if the tasks are small or big, that’s your journey. 

# Why not use any other todolist or tracker app?
Because I don't like them. I tried a lot of them, and failing a streak is the best way for me to abandon a new habit. 
If I have to create some gigantic todolist to create new habits or routine, it feels overwhelming and I’ll stop looking at them.
I want my to do list to be small and focus on tasks. 

# So what ?
Think like a reflecting app. 
At the end of the day, or whenever you want, you open the app and select or type the mundane things you did today.

It could be "got out of the bed" or "called mom", "emptied my to do list". It could be daily routine, like "fed the cats", or something punctual as "took an appointment with the dentist". 
The app doesn’t care. The app doesn’t judge. The app would not nudge you because it has been 2 months since you washed your bed sheets. Maybe you just forgot to cross it, for gods’ sake. 

But when you open the app and crossed the things you did, you will be congratulated. 
Then you close the app, go on the rest of your day or go to sleed, feeling you achieved something. 

That’s the whole point of it. 

And maybe, maaaaaybe, I’ll add some stats in another version fo the excel nerds out there. I too like to have stats.  

# What’s the plan
First of it, I want to setup the project to have a clean CI/CD pipeline and deploy on my VPS. So, nothing interesting really. 
Then, it will be the main page : having a simple input, you type what you did, it’s checked, and you can add more. That’s all. 

I will use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to create, maintain and test the components. 

I have no fraking idea of the app design, so gods help me, or anyone who feels like giving a hand. 
But in the time being, I’ll be building the app with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).

# So, how would I do it ?

That’s the generated part of the README :

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
